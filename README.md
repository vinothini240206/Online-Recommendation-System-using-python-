Online Retail Recommendation System

If you have tried online shopping, you must have noticed that when you are
checking out a product on an e-Commerce site, there is a list of suggested
products that you are presented with. In this project, you will develop a
recommendation system.

For this, we are attaching a dataset containing information about
recommendation systems for online retail data, so that we can understand what
type of product can be recommended.

We are providing a dataset from Kaggle, which contains historical information
about online retail data which can be usedto detect which product is highly
recommended. Below are all
the columns from the dataset we are using here

Invoice Number: This is the number that identifies a
transaction.Stock Code: This refers to the product ID.
Description: This describes the product that a user
purchased.Quantity: It specified the quantity of the item
purchased.
Invoice Date: The date on which the transaction took
place.Unit Price: Price of one product.
Customer ID: It identifies the customer.

Country: The country where the transaction was performed.
Language Used: Python
